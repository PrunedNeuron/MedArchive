  {
    "drugName": "Furosemide",
    "drugClassification": "diuretics",
    "drugMechanism": "Furosemide, like other loop diuretics, acts by inhibiting the luminal Na-K-Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, by binding to the chloride transport channel, thus causing sodium, chloride, and potassium loss in urine."
  },
  {
    "drugName": "Amlodipine",
    "drugClassification": "calcium channel blocker",
    "drugMechanism": "Amlodipine is an angioselective calcium channel blocker and inhibits the movement of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells which inhibits the contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle cells."

  {
    "drugName": "Cyclosporine",
    "drugClassification": "calcineurin inhibitors",
    "drugMechanism": "Cyclosporine causes inhibition of the production of cytokines involved in the regulation of T-cell activation. In particular, cyclosporine inhibits the transcription of interleukin 2."
  },
  {
    "drugName": "Cefuroxime",
    "drugClassification": "cephalosporin",
    "drugMechanism": "Cefurioxime exerts bactericidal activity by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis and inhibiting cross-linking of the peptidoglycan."

  },
  {
    "drugName": "Nitroglycerin",
    "drugClassification": "nitrate",
    "drugMechanism": "Nitroglycerin is denitrated by mALDH in smooth muscle and other cells. This results in the release of nitrite ion, which is then converted to nitric oxide. Nitric oxide that is released stimulates guanylyl cyclase in smooth muscle, producing an increase in cGMP which causes vasodilation."
  },
  {
    "drugName": "Atorvastatin",
    "drugClassification": "statin",
    "drugMechanism": "Atorvastatin competitively inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. By preventing the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, statin medications decrease cholesterol production in the liver."
  },
  {
    "drugName": "Vancomycin",
    "drugClassification": "glycopeptide",
    "drugMechanism": "Vancomycin inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminal of the growing peptide chain during cell wall synthesis, resulting in inhibition of the transpeptidase, which prevents further elongation and cross-linking of the peptidoglycan matrix."
  },
  {
    "drugName": "Linezolid",
    "drugClassification": "oxazolidinone",
    "drugMechanism": "Linezolid inhibits protein synthesis by binding to a site on the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit. This prevents formation of the 70S ribosomal unit; therefore protein synthesis is inhibited."
  },
  {
    "drugName": "Prochlorperazine",
    "drugClassification": "phenothiazine",
    "drugMechanism": "Prochlorperazine primarily works by depressing the chemoreceptor trigger zone and blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the brain. It was shown to also block histaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic receptors."
  },
  {
    "drugName": "Ondansetron",
    "drugClassification": "5HT3 antagonist",
    "drugMechanism": "Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents 8,9,10. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex by antagonizing 5HT3."
  },
  {
    "drugName": "Acetylcysteine",
    "drugClassification": "amino acid",
    "drugMechanism": "Acetylcysteine (and its metabolic byproduct cysteine) exerts its mucolytic action through its free sulfhydryl group, which reduces the disulfide bonds in the mucus matrix and lowers mucus viscosity."
  },
  {
    "drugName": "Artesunate",
    "drugClassification": "artemisinin derivative",
    "drugMechanism": "Artesunate is metabolized to the active DHA. The endoperoxide bridge of DHA reacts with heme, generating free radicals which inhibit protein and nucleic acid synthesis of the Plasmodium parasites during all erythrocytic stages."

    "drugName": "Venlafaxine",
    "drugClassification": "antidepressant",
    "drugMechanism": "Venlafaxine's mechanism of action is believed to involve inhibition of the uptake pumps for serotonin and norepinephrine with inhibition of norepinephrine uptake particularly relevant at higher doses."

  {
    "drugName": "Levetiracetam",
    "drugClassification": "anticonvulsant",
    "drugMechanism": "Levetiracetam's novel mechanism of action is modulation of synaptic neurotransmitter release through binding to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A in the brain."

  {
    "drugName": "Propranolol",
    "drugClassification": "beta blocker",
    "drugMechanism": "Propranolol competitively blocks both β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors. When access to β-receptor sites is blocked by Propranolol, the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately."

  {
    "drugName": "Metformin",
    "drugClassification": "biguanide",
    "drugMechanism": "Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization."

    "drugName": "Diltiazem",
    "drugClassification": "calcium channel blocker",
    "drugMechanism": "Diltiazem inhibits the inflow of calcium ions into the cardiac smooth muscle during depolarization. Reduced intracellular calcium concentrations equate to increased smooth muscle relaxation resulting in arterial vasodilation and, therefore, decreased blood pressure."
